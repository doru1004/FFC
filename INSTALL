To install FFC, type

    sudo python setup.py install

This will install FFC in the default Python path of your system,
something like /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/.

The installation script requires the Python module distutils, which
for Debian users is available with the python-dev package.  Other
dependencies are listed in the file README.

For detailed installation instructions, see the FFC user manual which
is available on http://fenicsproject.org/ and also in the subdirectory
doc/manual/ of this source tree.
